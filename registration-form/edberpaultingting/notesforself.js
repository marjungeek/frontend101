/*
Own Steps for using OOP and classes on JavaScript, Simple Example with 1 HTML Page only

Step 1: Connect HTML to JS Files that will handle the HTML form  (Line 1 regform.js)
Step 2: Make a main JS file that will be the one loaded when HTML file is opened (Line 2 main.js)
Step 3: Import the JS file that handles the HTML page to the main JS (regorm.js Line 2, main.js Line 1)
Step 4: Because I have to load something when HTML page loads, create a self invoking function (main.js Line 4)
Step 5: Get the country list from API by connecting httpclient.js
        and regform.js (httpclient.js Line 4; regform.js Lines 1,4,24) [All API related stuff is in httpclient.js]
Step 5.1: Create httpRequest and getRequest on httpclient.js(httpclient.js Line)
Step 6: Display country list on HTML
Step 6.1: Create on regform.js the loadCountries to be able to display to the HTML
