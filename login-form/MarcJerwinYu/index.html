					<h3>DOH : COVID-19 cases high among children below 2 yrs old,
						teens aged 15 - 19
					</h3>
					<p>(Catherine Gonzales, July 12, 2021)</p>
				</header>
				<p>We have data of cases from those aged 19 and below. These are the ages that are part of the pediatrics group. 
					If we look at this data, the high number of cases are from those aged less than two years.					
				</p>
				<p>As the age increases, COVID-19 cases are higher among those aged 15 to 19.
					This is being studied but of course, we will assume that they are closely
					monitored and cared for by their mothers and this is probably where the 
					infection is coming from.

				</header>

					<h3>Western countries reaffirm PH maritime claims in South China Sea</h3>
					<p>(Raymond Carl Dela Cruz, July 12, 2021)</p>
				</header>
				<p>The United States of America (US), the European Union (EU), and several other western 
					countries have reaffirmed their support to the Philippines’ claim in the South China Sea 
					on the fifth anniversary of The Hague’s Arbitral Tribunal ruling.</p>
				<p>In a statement, Antony Blinken, US Secretary of State, said the US reaffirms its policy 
					regarding maritime claims in the South China Sea it released almost a year ago on July 13, 2020, 
					noting that the Arbitral Tribunal delivered a “unanimous and enduring decision” rejecting China's 
					maritime claims as having “no basis on international law.”</p>

					<h3>Taal records 185 volcanic quaakes in last 24 hours</h3>
					<p>(Ma. Cristina Arayata, July 12, 2021)</p>
				</header>
				<p>Restive Taal Volcano has a total of 185 volcanic earthquakes 
					recorded in the past 24 hours, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology 
					and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Monday. The figure includes seven low-frequency 
					volcanic quakes, 176 volcanic tremors that lasted 1 to 16 minutes, and a low-level 
					background tremor that has persisted since July 7.</p>
				<p>Volcanic quakes are caused by movements or eruptions of magma from the volcano, 
					compared to tectonic quakes which are caused by fault movements. Taal also continues 
					to generate high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas emissions, with an average of 6,421 
					tonnes/day on July 11.</p>
